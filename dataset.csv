1,"BACKGROUND: Xuesaitong dispersible tablet (XST) product has been clinically proven to be effective for treating cardio-cerebrovascular disease. Furthermore, herb-drug interactions between the XST product and drugs that are commonly co-administered, such as aspirin (ASA), must be explored to ensure safe clinical use. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The current study aims to investigate whether the XST product interacts with ASA when they are administered concomitantly to ensure safety and efficacy. A ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was developed for the simultaneous determination of ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1), ginsenoside Rd (Rd), notoginsenoside R1 (R1) and salicylic acid (SA) in rat plasma to investigate the pharmacokinetic interaction of XST and ASA in blood stasis model rats. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The ASA and XST combination noticeably altered R1 and Rg1 absorption, distribution and disposition. This study indicates that co-administration of XST and ASA can cause an apparent herb-drug pharmacokinetic interaction in blood stasis model rats. ","Aspirin, Xuesaitong dispersible tablet"
2,"Arterial hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and renal events. Lowering blood pressure is thus an important strategy for reducing morbidity and mortality. Since low-dose aspirin is a cornerstone in the prevention of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, combined treatment with aspirin and antihypertensive drugs is very common. However, the impact of aspirin therapy on blood pressure control remains a subject of intense debate. Recent data suggest that the cardioprotective action of aspirin extends beyond its well-known antithrombotic effect. Aspirin has been shown to trigger the synthesis of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators from arachidonic acid and omega-3 fatty acids. These novel anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators actively stimulate the resolution of inflammation and tissue regeneration. Additionally, they may contribute to other protective effects on redox status and vascular reactivity that have also been attributed to aspirin. Of note, aspirin has been shown to improve vasodilation through cyclooxygenase-independent mechanisms. On the other hand, higher aspirin doses have been reported to exert a negative impact on blood pressure due to inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 activity, which reduces renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and sodium and water excretion. This review aims to provide an overview of the effects of aspirin on blood pressure and the underlying mechanisms, focusing on the interaction between aspirin and antihypertensive drugs. Studies in both experimental and human hypertension are presented.","Aspirin, antihypertensive drugs"
3,"Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)-based herbal therapies have gained increasing popularity worldwide, raising concerns of its efficacy, safety profile and potential interactions with Western medications. Antithrombotic agents are among the most common prescription drugs involved in herb-drug interactions, and this article focused on aspirin, one of the most widely used antiplatelet agents worldwide. We discussed herbs that have potential interactions by exploring Western and TCM approaches to thrombotic events. Common TCM indications for these herbs were also highlighted, including possible scenarios of their concurrent usage with aspirin. With greater awareness and understanding of potential herb-drug interactions, TCM and Western physicians may collaborate more closely to identify, treat and, most importantly, prevent adverse drug events.","Aspirin, herbs"
4,"INTRODUCTION: The aging of the population in the US and other countries means that a large number of people will likely take NSAIDs for the relief of pain and low-dose aspirin (LD-ASA) for cardioprotection. However, the cardioprotective value of LD-ASA can be compromised in patients who take NSAIDs concomitantly, because some NSAIDs competitively bind to critical amino-acid residues on cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and interfere with the mechanism of antiplatelet activity of LD-ASA. AREAS COVERED: A review of the literature was conducted to provide an overview of current issues surrounding the concomitant use of NSAIDs and LD-ASA, to explore potential mechanisms for this drug-drug interaction and to consider current and future treatment options that may mitigate the risk associated with their concomitant use. EXPERT OPINION: NSAIDs offer effective pain relief for the most common forms of pain, such as low back pain, musculoskeletal pain associated with arthritis, postsurgical pain, headache, acute pain syndromes, menstrual pain and dental pain. The development of NSAID formulations that offer effective pain control with fewer or less serious adverse effects due to interference with ASA would be a valuable medical advance. Several promising treatment options and regimens may be available in the future.","Aspirin, NSAIDs"
5,"The effects of antibiotics on the intestinal flora can create potential drug-drug interactions. The combination of amoxicillin and aspirin is high and there is a high probability of interaction. We used 16S rRNA, incubation experiments and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to analyze rat biological samples to characterize the effect of amoxicillin on the pharmacokinetics of aspirin metabolites. We first discovered that amoxicillin reduced the species and number of intestinal flora in rats, such as reducing the abundance of Helicobacter pylori and Prevotella_copri. After 12, 24, and 36 hours of incubation, the remaining amount of aspirin in the aspirin and amoxicillin treatment groups decreased, and salicylic acid production increased, suggesting that aspirin is metabolized by the intestinal flora, and the main metabolite is salicylic acid. As the incubation time prolonged, the reduction of aspirin and the production of salicylic acid in the amoxicillin treatment group were slower. It is indicated that the metabolic activity of aspirin through the intestinal flora is slowed down after administration of amoxicillin. The pharmacokinetic experiments showed that after administration of amoxicillin, the area under the salicylic acid curve increased by 91.38%, the peak concentration increased by 60.43%, and the clearance rate decreased by 43.55%.The results demonstrated that amoxicillin affected the pharmacokinetics of aspirin active metabolite salicylic acid by slowing down the metabolic activity of intestinal flora on aspirin. The interaction between amoxicillin and aspirin mediated by the intestinal flora may affect the efficacy of aspirin and cause more significant adverse effects","Aspirin, amoxicillin"
6,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine leads to interactions in pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics (PDs). In this study, the influence of salvianolate and aspirin on metabolic enzymes, and the relationship between the blood concentration and pharmacodynamic indexes, were determined. METHOD: In this, randomized, parallel-grouped, single-center clinical trial, 18 patients with coronary heart disease were randomly allocated into three groups: aspirin (AP) group, salvianolate (SV) group, and combination (A + S) group. All treatment courses lasted for 10 days, and blood samples were acquired before and after administration at different timepoints. The expression of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), CD62p, procaspase-activating compound 1 (PAC-1), P2Y12, phosphodiesterase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8) were compared with variance analysis The blood concentrations were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Sixteen subjects completed the study. No significant difference in COMT was found among groups, although there was a decrease in the SV group. The PK results indicated that the absorption time of salicylic acid was shortened and the AUC0-∞ decreased and the elimination time of salvianolic acid B was prolonged and the AUC0-∞ decreased. The PD results declined after administration. A significant difference was found in MAPK8, CD62p, and P2Y12 expression. Compared with the SV group, a significant difference in P2Y12 in the A + S group was found. CONCLUSION: A pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction was found in the aspirin and salvianolate combination. Pharmacodynamically, there was no difference between the A + S and AP groups. However, P2Y12 expression in the combination group was superior to that in the SV group.","Aspirin, salvianolate"
